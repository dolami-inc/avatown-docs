## Prerequisites

### Unity

To ensure compatibility, it is recommended to download and install `Unity 2022.3.22f1`, which can be obtained from the [official Unity website](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.22). This version aligns with the one used by VRChat.

**Important**:
VRChat requires Unity 2022 for its latest SDK. Users still utilizing Unity 2019 are strongly advised to upgrade, as future SDK updates will not be accessible on outdated versions. Additionally, content created in older versions may experience compatibility issues.

### VRchat Creator Companion

The VRChat Creator Companion is required for setting up VRChat projects. Please refer to the [official VRChat documentation](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com) for installation instructions.
