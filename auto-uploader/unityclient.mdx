## Prerequisites

### Unity

For this we specifically recommend downloading unity `2022.3.22.f1` version from [here](https://unity.com/releases/editor/whats-new/2022.3.22). The same version is also used by VRchat. 
As we proceed, it expected that you have downloaded and installed `Unity 2022.3.22f1`.

From VRchat: Unity 2022 is required to use the latest version of the VRchat SDK, and we strongly recommend upgrading if you are still on Unity 2019. 
Without upgrading, you can't access any future SDK updates, and some previously made content might experience issues.

### VRchat Creator Companion

We will also need VRchat Creator companion. [Follow this offcial guide](https://vcc.docs.vrchat.com/) from VRchat. This documentation will guide you to download and install VRchat Creator Companion.
